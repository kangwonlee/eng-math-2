# Engineering Math II: Visualized Examples

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with Python code for visualizing examples from the "Advanced Engineering Mathematics" textbook by Dennis G. Zill (Jones & Bartlett Learning). These visualizations are intended to supplement the textbook and help students gain a deeper understanding of key concepts through interactive examples.
